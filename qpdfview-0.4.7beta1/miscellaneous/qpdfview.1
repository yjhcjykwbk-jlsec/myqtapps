.SH NAME
qpdfview \- tabbed document viewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qpdfview
.I [options] [--] [file[#page]] [file[#src:name:line:column]] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qpdfview
is a simple viewer for document files in the portable document format (PDF). It uses the Poppler library for rendering and the Qt toolkit for its interface.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-\-help"
Displays usage information.
.IP "\-\-quiet"
Suppresses warning messages which are displayed if the program fails to open a file.
.IP "\-\-search text"
Initiates a search for
.I text
in the current tab.
.IP \-\-unique
If an instance of qpdfview is started with this option, any files that are opened using this option afterwards, are opened as tabs in the original window. If a file is already opened in a tab of the original window, it is merely reloaded.
.IP "\-\-instance name"
Uses
.I name
as the name of the instance contacted or created using the "\-\-unique" option. This allows one to run multiple instances and remotely open and refresh tabs in any of them by passing the instance name. The argument must only contain the characters "[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_" and must not begin with a digit.
.IP "\-\-choose-instance"
Can be combined with the "\-\-unique" option to display a dialog at start-up where the instance name can be chosen with all instances that have tabs stored as suggestions.
.IP [file[#page]]
.I file
specifies the file to open. The optional parameter
.I page
opens the file at the given page. Multiple files will be opened in separate tabs.
.IP [file[#src:name:line:column]]
Forward search using SyncTeX is performed using the optional parameters
.I name
which is the name of the source file,
.I line
which is the line number in the source file and
.I column
which is the column number in the source file where the number 0 matches all lines respectively columns.
